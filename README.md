# DEGENTOKEN | USING AVAX
This is the project submission of module 4 of the `ETH_AVAX_INTERMEDIATE` course provided by `Metacrafters`.

## Description

In this project, I created a token named `DEGEN` and the symbol `DGN`. This token is built to reward players in a game which can be redeemed in `shopItems` to buy exclusive game items. Also, it is created to be deployed on the `AVALANCHE Blockchain`.

## Getting Started

### Installing

- Fork this repository and clone it into your workspace.
- You have to set up `npm` and `hardhat` in your folder and then clone this contract in your contracts.
- You can use `REMIX IDE` to interact with this smart contract as well. But you need to use the `injected provider` environment.
- Also, you need to have some AVAX tokens in your metamask account to deploy the contract. 

### Points to Remember

- You can visit `https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c&token=c` here to get some AVAX tokens for testing purposes.
- You can track your transactions here: `https://testnet.snowtrace.io/`.
- Make sure to switch to the `AVALANCHE FUJI-C Chain` network on METAMASK as well.

## Functionality
This DEGENTOKEN contract provides several functionalities:

- `mintTokens`: By using this function, the owner can mint tokens to the receiver's account.
- `transferTokens`: This function is used to transfer tokens from the Sender to the Receiver's account.
- `burnTokens`: This function is used to burn tokens from the user's account.
- `redeemTokens`: Using this function, the user can buy game items present in the shop.
- `myPurchases`: This function is used to check your purchase history.
- `checkTokenBalance`: This function is used to check the token balance of the user.

You can refer to the contract code to understand the implementation of the functions.
